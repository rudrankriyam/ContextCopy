# Build Workflow

When developing a new feature or fixing a bug, always follow this sequence:

1.  **Clean:** Clean the build artifacts to ensure a fresh state.
2.  **Rebuild:** Build the project again.
3.  **Run:** Launch the application to test the changes.

This helps prevent issues caused by stale build caches.
